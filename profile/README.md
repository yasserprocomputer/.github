## ðŸ“‹ Plan

I have a lot of plans actually but first I have to achieve these:

- Earning money online to start working and investing on projects. Money may also be invested on the next videos.
- Making video games (Single player and Multiplayer). *Multiplayer may needs money. Yet, I still have to learn about game development.*
- Making an AI.
- Freelancing if I could.
- Making some websites.
